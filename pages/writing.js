              ‘We are at the beginning of a mass extinction and all you can talk about is money and fairytales of eternal economic growth?’ So said Greta Thunberg in her outraged speech at the UN Climate Action Summit, which brought a new public awareness to the issue of limitless GDP growth. That same day, I was on my way to Norway, to visit the seventh edition of the Oslo Triennale, the Nordic region’s biggest architecture festival, curated for this 2019 edition by a team consisting of Matthew Dalziel, Phineas Harper, Cecilie Sachs Olsen and Maria Smith. The timing of Thunberg’s statement was convenient, since the subject of the edition, degrowth, offered a highly relevant inquiry into the limits to growth in economic, social and architectural terms.

              An anarcho-queer collective wanders in the outer space of  Florence, Italy. The outlandish astronauts land on an abandoned planet and decide to squat it – this celestial body is named Urania and the settlers call themselves the Uranesse.

              I always found surprising that a stern modern architect such as Adolf Loos would write a book titled Why a Man Should be Well Dressed, making a serious intellectual endeavour in on one of the most trivialised aesthetic matters, fashion. Fashion is a discipline architects seem to be hesitant or dismissive about. Often pulling an antagonistic attitude towards the fashion system, few architects were seriously committed to fashion design and criticism.

             Florentine Radical Architecture died at the premature age of 50 years old and is now been carried in funeral processions. Large exhibitions, such as Super Superstudio at the PAC in Milan in 2015, Superstudio 50 at the MAXXI in Rome in 2016 (recently restaged at the Power Station of Art in Shangai) and finally Utopie Radicali at the Strozzina in Florence, pay tribute to the memory of the Italian Radicals.

              Beginning the description of a city with an account of its climate seems like a tired literary trope or a British postcard mannerism. “I hope you are better employed than in gaping after weather”; even Keats deprecated himself after a lengthy description of his weather-feelings.

              “I believe that if I were commissioned to design a new universe I would be mad enough to undertake it.”
              Piranesi’s words sum up his monumental sense of grandiosity and bravado and, unfortunately, that of many much less visionary architects. Yet this wild fantasy of conceiving a whole new universe can be realised in the virtual gamespace. Video games, bringing together the worlds of computation, narrative and experiential space in one medium, are becoming a new model of architectural representation. As such, gamespace can be used as a testing ground to design our future cities, a place where utopian thoughts are elaborated and experimented, an artificial arena where there are no rules except those set by the programmer.

              My mother has a penchant for modernist furniture. Our living room is a carefully choreographed landscape of Eames Lounge Chairs, Le Corbusier’s LC2 armchairs, low crystal coffee tables, a couple of small marble Eero Saarinen Tulip tables. Altogether a rather generic and cold interior, a posh Gesamkunstwerk complete with a treadmill and a bench for abdominals, scattered African artefacts, a white cat. And of course a fireplace, needless to say, a modernist angular fireplace in black marble and tek wood. Despite its funereal look, sitting in front of it is one of the finest wintery delights. Around a month ago, after a Sunday lunch, my grandmother sat on the LC2 armchair in front of the fireplace and got stuck in it.
